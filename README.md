## Description

Tiktok clone app made as practice for creating frontend with React and backend with Express

## Features

- User authentication (login/register)

## Challenges

- This project was my first substantial endeavor involving both backend and frontend development using JavaScript. While it was a significant learning experience, the final product contains numerous bugs and the codebase is quite disorganized. Consequently, I have not deployed this project, nor do I include it in my portfolio.
